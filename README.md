# Hyrox Workout Generator App

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a dedicated, intelligent web application for Hyrox athletes to effectively plan and track their training. The app will address key pain points such as inconsistent workout planning, lack of integrated performance tracking, and limited personalized guidance in existing solutions.

### Core Features (MVP)
-   **Workout Generation Engine:** Generates Hyrox-specific workout plans with basic customization, variety, and progression across running and functional movements.
-   **Workout Logging & Tracking:** Allows users to log performance data for completed workouts and visualize basic progress trends over time.

### Technical Stack
-   **Frontend:** React/Next.js
-   **Backend:** Node.js (potentially within Next.js API routes or serverless functions)
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Hosting:** Vercel (for frontend)

### Constraints
-   **Budget:** Free, utilizing free-tier services.
-   **Timeline:** MVP to be built within a few hours.
-   **Resources:** Solo project.

### Development Status
1.  ‚úÖ Project Setup (repository, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Vercel)
2.  ‚úÖ Detailed Technical Design for MVP
3.  ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** (Next.js initialized, database schema ready)
