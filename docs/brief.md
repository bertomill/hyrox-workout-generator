# Project Brief: hyrox-workout-generator

## Executive Summary


## Problem Statement: Hyrox Workout Planning & Tracking

Hyrox athletes, from beginners to advanced competitors, face significant challenges in effectively planning and tracking their training. The current state is characterized by:

-   **Manual, often inconsistent workout planning:** Athletes struggle to design varied, progressive workouts that effectively combine running and functional movements, often relying on generic templates or ad-hoc routines. This leads to inefficient training, plateaus, and increased risk of overtraining or injury.
-   **Lack of integrated performance tracking:** There's no centralized or streamlined way to track key workout metrics (times, reps, weights, distances) across different functional movements and running segments. This makes it difficult to monitor progress, identify strengths and weaknesses, and adjust training plans accordingly.
-   **Limited personalized guidance:** Existing solutions often lack the specificity required for Hyrox, which demands a unique blend of endurance and strength. Generic fitness apps don't adequately cater to the specific structure, exercises, and progression needed for Hyrox events.
-   **Difficulty in visualizing progress:** Without proper tracking and analysis, athletes find it hard to see their improvements over time, which can impact motivation and long-term adherence to a training program.

The impact of this problem is significant: athletes may underperform in competitions, experience slower progress in their training, become demotivated due to a lack of clear insights, and potentially face injuries from unoptimized training loads.

Existing general fitness apps or manual methods (spreadsheets, notebooks) fall short because they lack the Hyrox-specific structure, exercise variations, and the ability to integrate and analyze combined running and functional workout data. There's a clear urgency to solve this, as the popularity of Hyrox competitions continues to grow, increasing the demand for specialized training tools.

## Proposed Solution: Hyrox Workout Generator App

The `hyrox-workout-generator` app is envisioned as a dedicated, intelligent platform designed specifically for Hyrox athletes to overcome the challenges of workout planning and performance tracking. Its core concept revolves around providing:

-   **Personalized, Adaptive Workout Generation:** The app will intelligently generate Hyrox-specific training plans, adapting to the user's current fitness level, goals, and available equipment. It will ensure variety and progressive overload across running and functional movements.
-   **Integrated Performance Tracking & Analytics:** A seamless interface will allow users to easily log their workout results (times, reps, weights, distances) for each Hyrox station and running segment. The app will then provide visual analytics to track progress over time, highlight trends, and identify areas for improvement.
-   **Hyrox-Specific Exercise Library & Guidance:** A comprehensive library of Hyrox-relevant exercises with proper form guidance and scaling options will ensure users are always training effectively and safely.
-   **Community & Competition Focus (Future Vision):** While the initial focus is on individual training, the long-term vision includes features for friendly competition, sharing workouts, and potentially integrating with official Hyrox event data.

**Key Differentiators:**

The primary differentiator for the `hyrox-workout-generator` is its **deep, personal understanding of the Hyrox athlete's needs**, as it's being developed by a Hyrox athlete (you!) who knows exactly what's missing from existing solutions. This ensures the app will be built with genuine insights into the nuances of Hyrox training, addressing pain points that generic fitness apps overlook. It will offer a more tailored and intuitive experience than anything currently available.

**Why this solution will succeed:**

This solution will succeed because it directly addresses the critical gaps in the Hyrox training ecosystem with a highly focused and user-centric approach. By providing intelligent workout generation, robust tracking, and specific Hyrox context, it empowers athletes to train more effectively, stay motivated, and achieve their competitive goals. The "built by an athlete, for athletes" philosophy will foster trust and deliver a truly valuable tool.

**High-level vision for the product:**

To become the indispensable training partner for every Hyrox athlete, simplifying complex training logistics and providing actionable insights that drive performance improvements.

## Post-MVP Vision


## Technical Considerations

These are initial thoughts and preferences to guide the technical direction of the `hyrox-workout-generator` app.

#### **Platform Requirements**

-   **Target Platforms:** Web application with Progressive Web App (PWA) capability for seamless installation and use on iOS (and potentially Android) devices. This prioritizes broad accessibility while offering a native-like mobile experience.
-   **Browser/OS Support:** The web app should be designed for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and responsive across various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
-   **Performance Requirements:** The application should be performant, with quick loading times and a smooth user interface, especially during workout generation and data logging, to ensure a positive user experience.

#### **Technology Preferences**

-   **Frontend:** React/Next.js for building a dynamic and efficient user interface. Next.js offers benefits like server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG), which can improve performance and SEO (though less critical for a personal app initially).
-   **Backend:** Given the preference for React/Next.js, a Node.js backend (e.g., with Express.js or integrated within Next.js API routes) would offer a consistent JavaScript ecosystem. Alternatively, a lightweight serverless function approach could be considered for scalability and cost efficiency if Next.js API routes are not sufficient.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust, relational data storage. This is suitable for structured workout data, user profiles, and performance metrics, ensuring data integrity and query flexibility.
-   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Vercel for hosting the frontend (Next.js application), leveraging its capabilities for fast deployments, global CDN, and easy integration with serverless functions. A separate service (e.g., Supabase, Railway, Render) would host the PostgreSQL database.

#### **Architecture Considerations**

-   **Repository Structure:** A monorepo approach could be considered if the project grows to include separate backend services or shared UI components, but a simpler integrated Next.js project structure is sufficient for the MVP.
-   **Service Architecture:** For the MVP, a tightly coupled frontend and backend (e.g., Next.js API routes) would be the simplest approach. As the application scales, a more explicit API layer might be introduced.
-   **Integration Requirements:** Initial integrations will focus on internal data flow between the frontend, backend, and database. Future integrations might include fitness wearables or external Hyrox data sources.
-   **Security/Compliance:** Basic security considerations will be implemented, such as secure authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js or similar), input validation, and secure database interactions.

## Constraints & Assumptions

This section outlines the known limitations and key assumptions guiding the `hyrox-workout-generator` project, particularly for the MVP.

#### **Constraints**

-   **Budget:** The project must be developed and operated for free, utilizing free-tier services and open-source solutions wherever possible. This is a hard constraint that will influence technology choices (e.g., free database tiers, Vercel free tier).
-   **Timeline:** The initial build time for the MVP is strictly limited to "a few hours." This means an extreme focus on core functionality, minimal design, and leveraging existing components or rapid development techniques.
-   **Resources:** This is a solo project, meaning all development, design, and deployment tasks will be handled by a single individual. This reinforces the need for a highly focused MVP and efficient tools.
-   **Technical:** No significant technical hurdles are anticipated for the core MVP functionality, given the chosen tech stack and limited scope.

#### **Key Assumptions**

-   **"Few Hours" Build Time Feasibility:**
    -   It is assumed that the core features (workout generation and logging with basic UI) can be designed, implemented, and deployed within a "few hours" using the chosen tech stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Vercel) and by leveraging existing libraries/boilerplates for rapid development.
    -   This assumes prior familiarity and efficiency with the chosen technologies.
-   **Free Tier Sustainability:**
    -   It is assumed that the hosting (Vercel) and database (e.g., Supabase free tier or similar PostgreSQL provider) can adequately support the MVP's initial usage (personal use, then up to 100 users) within their respective free tiers.
    -   This implies minimal data storage, low API call volume, and efficient resource usage.
-   **Sufficient Feature Set for Value:**
    -   It is assumed that the narrowly defined MVP features (workout generation, logging, basic progress visualization) will provide sufficient value to me (the primary user) and the initial 100 users to solve their core pain points, even without advanced features.
    -   The generated workouts will be "good enough" without complex AI or deep personalization in the MVP.
-   **Direct User Input for Workout Generation:**
    -   For the MVP, it's assumed that workout generation can be driven by simple user inputs (e.g., fitness level, target event) rather than requiring complex machine learning models or extensive historical data analysis.
-   **Manual Data Input Tolerance:**
    -   Users will be willing to manually input their workout results for the MVP. Automated tracking via wearables or other devices is out of scope.
-   **No Major UI/UX Complexity:**
    -   The "few hours" constraint assumes a functional rather than highly polished UI/UX for the MVP. Design will be kept simple and straightforward.
