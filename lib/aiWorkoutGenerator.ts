- Fitness Level: ${fitnessLevel}
- Current Mood/Energy: ${moodDescriptions[mood]}
- Desired Intensity: ${intensityDescriptions[intensity]}
- Available Time: ${duration} minutes

**Constraints:**
${excludeStations.length > 0 ? `- MUST EXCLUDE these stations: ${excludeStations.join(', ')}` : '- No station exclusions'}

**Standard Hyrox Stations (adjust as needed):**
1. SkiErg - 1000m (cardio machine)
2. Sled Push - 50m with weight
3. Sled Pull - 50m with weight
4. Burpee Broad Jumps - 80m
5. Rowing - 1000m
6. Farmers Carry - 200m with kettlebells
7. Sandbag Lunges - 100m with sandbag
8. Wall Balls - 100 reps

**Official Hyrox Weights by Level:**
- Beginner: Sled Push 50kg, Sled Pull 70kg, Farmers 2x16kg, Sandbag 20kg, Wall Ball 4kg
- Intermediate: Sled Push 102kg, Sled Pull 78kg, Farmers 2x24kg, Sandbag 20kg, Wall Ball 6kg
- Advanced: Sled Push 152kg, Sled Pull 103kg, Farmers 2x32kg, Sandbag 30kg, Wall Ball 9kg

**Your Task:**
Create a workout that:
1. KEEP standard Hyrox distances/weights (don't modify the official standards above)
2. VARY the composition: select which stations to include based on mood and intensity
   - Fresh + Hard/Beast: Include all 8 stations
   - Normal + Moderate: Include 6-7 stations
   - Tired + Light: Include 4-5 stations (focus on technique)
   - Exhausted: Include 3-4 stations (recovery-focused)
3. Adjust run distances to fit the ${duration} minute timeframe
4. Respect the athlete's current energy state by varying volume (number of stations), not individual distances
5. Exclude any restricted stations
6. Provide coaching notes explaining which stations were selected and why

IMPORTANT: Each station should use its standard Hyrox distance/weight for the fitness level. Adjust the workout by including more or fewer stations, not by modifying individual exercise parameters.

Generate the workout with stations array, runs array, and optional coaching notes.`;
